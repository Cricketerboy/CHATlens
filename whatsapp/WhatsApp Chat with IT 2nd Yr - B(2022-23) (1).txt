19/10/22, 09:04 - +91 98995 61023: Dear students,
Each request to leave ST1 examination will not considered for ReSt.  Be serious and avoid it.
19/10/22, 10:58 - +91 92687 93832: Dear students ST1 and ST2 are important and mandatory academic activity. Each student must appear in these exams in first attempt without fail.
There is high probability to score good marks as ST1 syllabus is comparatively less than Re-ST. 
RE-ST is generally arrange for those students who have genuine medical reason and got prior approval from the HOD and Director sir.Also this re-exam has full syllabus and full marks. 
So be regular and appear in ST1 with 100% attendance and full participation.

I hope you are doing well in the university examinations.
This a reminder on ethics and code of conduct of Examination
It has come to our notice that during the University End semester exam at examination centre, some students were found in possession of unfair means like chits/papers/mobile phones/writings on hand or uniform. It is important for all of us to uphold the ethics and code of conduct of examinations. *A single UFM case may affect your marks further*, thus do not use any such means. 
It is crucial that we maintain academic integrity and fairness during exams.
Regards

17/04/23, 16:43 - +91 98736 33549: Dear Students,

After the huge success of the previous versions of virtual internship program where we provided virtual internships opportunities to more than 80,000 in Cyber Security, Networking & Cloud security area, we are pleased to share that today we are all set to kick start the registration for VIP 2023
 
As we know each year, approximately 1.2 million students look for a meaningful internship opportunity with one of India‚Äôs 3,000 engineering institutions. But there aren‚Äôt enough internships for everyone. Furthermore, with our world under pressure from the global pandemic and social unrest, this gap has widened.
This year in 2023 the program will cover Cyber Security, Cloud Security and Networking as key skill levels. This year any Cisco Networking Academy students currently enrolled in 1st, 2nd & 3rd year technical degree {(e.g., B.Tech, BCA, BSc (IT/CS), MCA, MSc (IT / CS)} and technical diploma students studying in 1st or 2nd year may participate in the program. 
The VIP is a revolutionary attempt to virtualize the traditional internship model and allow scalability during this challenging climate. In the current model:
¬∑         Students will gain technical knowledge and skills by completing Cisco Networking Academy courses in identified track.
¬∑         Students will learn to use the powerful network simulation tool ‚Äì Packet Tracer.
¬∑         Students will participate in an industry session hosted by Cisco experts and leaders which will cover topics from enabling a global skillset to careers in cybersecurity and networking.
¬∑         Accredited Networking Academy instructors will train faculty members from participating institutions to act as local mentors.
¬∑         With able guidance of the local mentor at the institution, shortlisted students will work on a project to solve an identified problem statement.
